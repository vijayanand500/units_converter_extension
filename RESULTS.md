## Methods
We started off signing up 10 colleagues who volunteered to perform tests on this current project. The project involves an unit converter extension. We initially provided the volunteers with the instructions to install this new chrome extension. We took observations about the ease of installing the extension. We asked the volunteers to try using our extension for various day-to-day tasks and explore the web using this extension. For example, checking out amazon shopping, using google maps to calculate distances and checking the temperature. After this, we asked them to download two different examples of  unit converter extensions, and try using that in comparison to our extension. The two existing extensions that were chosen, had the highest number of positive reviews on google and thus played as comparison models for this experiment. Before we conducted this survey, we pretested to find that 5 minutes was enough time to get familiarised with our extension and understand its benefits. 

## Materials

Example 1 -  Unit Converter https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unit-converter/igjeajmonjofckmiheidpmebpmdbbiam/related?hl=en

Example 2  - Everything Metric https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/everything-metric-auto-un/hknjpaididhfgeocegbacehlnkofjoni?hl=en

## Observations

<p align="center">

	The bar chart above shows that the volunteers found it considerably easy to use the extension.

	From the above graph we can see that the ‘currency’ conversion was the most used conversion among other unit conversions. This has nothing to do with the fact that the metric had more number of useful standards of conversion since all the metrics had 9 different standards to convert to. So, from this survey we can gather that some metrics being more popularly used than others, could have more number of conversion standards to display as a future update.

	Based on the observations we notice that our conversion extension is more preferred than the Unit Converter 0.0.0.5. Some of the popular reasons why, include:
- Easy to use and intuitive
- Hover over feature makes it easier and faster to use

	We can see that our unit conversion extension is more preferred than the 
‘Everything Metric’. Some of the popular reasons why, include:
- Many options
- Did not modify the webpage as such. Gave a drop down which is dynamic.

	Though many people have given good ratings for the converter extension, we received some information about things to improve in the project.
Some of the popular ones include:
- Copy paste functionality was not present from the drop down and can be added. (50% stated this feature)
- Its confuses pounds of weight and currency
- Although the whole text changing is convenient, customization about the number of units to display and what units to display could have been improved.

## Conclusions

- We can conclude that the extension that we tested is better than any other existing extension. Our participants also agreed that they would like to use this extension after this experiment as well.
- Example 1, a very similar implementation, involved taking manual input from the user for every conversion. This clearly proved to be an inconvenient method in comparison to ours.
- Example 2, kind of implements the opposite idea of our project, where the user need not ask for the output conversion by hovering over the input, but automatically converts and displays the webpage with metrics converted into a particular type of standard. While this is useful, most people still prefered our extension, because the user might want to see different standards of the metric at the same time and not require other conversions.   


## Threat to Validity

- Insufficient Sample Size - In order to come up to a valid conclusion, a sample size of 10 is too small. Hence this plays the biggest role in shaking the validity of our conclusion or inference. For example it would be ideal to have a sample population with equal experience in all the three languages.
- We compared the project with only two of the popular unit conversion extensions available online. This might not provide a comprehensive comparison of the project with all the counterparts online as there are many more extensions for metric conversion, which are similar to this project.
- The test only covered black box testing. This experiment lacked a functional white box testing. Since the volunteers cannot be expected to know the internal functionalities of the project, a white box testing might not be readily feasible.
- The test involved gathering qualitative feedback from the volunteers, rather than a more quantitative test involving recording the time taken for conversion.
- The participants were allowed a short testing time frame, in which they might not have come across all the differences and shortcomings of the current conversion extension, A testing tie frame of over days for the participants might yield accurate and more comprehensive test results.
