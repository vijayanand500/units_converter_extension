## Methods
We started off signing up 10 colleagues who volunteered to perform tests on this current project. The project involves an unit converter extension. We initially provided the volunteers with the instructions to install this new chrome extension. We took observations about the ease of installing the extension. We asked the volunteers to try using our extension for various day-to-day tasks and explore the web using this extension. For example, checking out amazon shopping, using google maps to calculate distances and checking the temperature. After this, we asked them to download two different examples of  unit converter extensions, and try using that in comparison to our extension. The two existing extensions that were chosen, had the highest number of positive reviews on google and thus played as comparison models for this experiment. Before we conducted this survey, we pretested to find that 5 minutes was enough time to get familiarised with our extension and understand its benefits.

## Conclusions

-We can conclude that the extension that we tested is better than any other existing extension. Our participants also agreed that they would like to use this extension after this experiment as well.
-Example 1, a very similar implementation, involved taking manual input from the user for every conversion. This clearly proved to be an inconvenient method in comparison to ours.
-Example 2, kind of implements the opposite idea of our project, where the user need not ask for the output conversion by hovering over the input, but automatically converts and displays the webpage with metrics converted into a particular type of standard. While this is useful, most people still prefered our extension, because the user might want to see different standards of the metric at the same time and not require other conversions.   


## Threat to Validity

- Insufficient Sample Size - In order to come up to a valid conclusion, a sample size of 10 is too small. Hence this plays the biggest role in shaking the validity of our conclusion or inference. For example it would be ideal to have a sample population with equal experience in all the three languages.
- We compared the project with only two of the popular unit conversion extensions available online. This might not provide a comprehensive comparison of the project with all the counterparts online as there are many more extensions for metric conversion, which are similar to this project.
- The test only covered black box testing. This experiment lacked a functional white box testing. Since the volunteers cannot be expected to know the internal functionalities of the project, a white box testing might not be readily feasible.
- The test involved gathering qualitative feedback from the volunteers, rather than a more quantitative test involving recording the time taken for conversion.
- The participants were allowed a short testing time frame, in which they might not have come across all the differences and shortcomings of the current conversion extension, A testing tie frame of over days for the participants might yield accurate and more comprehensive test results.
